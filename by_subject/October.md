Breaking routine is not something that comes easily or often to me. Not posting was breaking routine and realizing I forgot to post is validating how off kilter I feel in an assessment scenario...The plant world is changing rapidly these days. Yesterday I cycled by a bunch of plant communities and thought the caption "what leaves?" Soon I will take some photos to go along with that caption.*
