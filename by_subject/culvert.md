Caption: *Mill Creek passes under Highway 97 through these three tube thingies. As if raising a middle finger to those who decided this course for the creek, who would prefer, as far as I understand it, to move as she pleases, 1.7 of these tubes are blocked on the other side of the road by foliage and such. This may be bad news in the actual spring.*

Alt-text: *Dry plant matter lines a creek, which flows off one side of the frame and through three metal archways under a grassy knoll at it's other end. Lined by concrete on one side.*

Alt-text: *A field of dry grass in which lays a large corrugated metal pipe, which is beginning to rust at its mouth. The late stage rust matches the colour of the leafless bushes in the background and the early yellowish rust resembles the grasses.*

Alt-text: *Two culverts, about two metres apart, one grated, the other fenced. Between them, along the banks, collects an herbaceous plant I've learned to call tarragon, and in the water, a whole lo of flowering water cress, bushy and imposing.*

Caption: *Diffraction patterning.*

Alt-text: *Human shadows peer down over a large metal pike through which runs a ditch. Most of the foliage is obscured by overexposure, but some tule can be seen in the shadows, leaning over as if pushed down by a once more ferocious flow of water.*

Caption: *Really though, this is the last one, and when I come back little bits of spring may have already sprung.*

Alt-text: *A series of parallel iron rods, painted white, serve to catch large debris that flows through the adjacent culvert. The rods are reflected in the water, making them appear twice as long. The reed-dominated foliage along the bank of the creek is dry and there is a bit of snow on the ground.*
