Caption: *I feel sad about forgetting to post these photos. They're all from about a week ago, Wednesday October 27th, while I was still writing part two of my comprehensive exams. Just two weeks away from a year of doing this and I forgot to post photos I'd taken for the first time. This is completionism angst at its finest: frivolous and grating. Breaking routine is not something that comes easily or often to me. Not posting was breaking routine and realizing I forgot to post is validating how off kilter I feel in an assessment scenario...The plant world is changing rapidly these days. Yesterday I cycled by a bunch of plant communities and thought the caption "what leaves?" Soon I will take some photos to go along with that caption.*

Alt-text: *Three prominent leaves of red osier dogwood illuminated by the sun and, while predominantly pink, are also speckled with green, yellow, brown, and black.*
